        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Living in the Raleigh-Durham area, I work as a PHP developer at <a
          href="http://aje.com">American Journal Experts</a>.  In addition to
          my full time job, I also co-own a consulting business, <a
          href="http://tortugas-llc.com">Tortugas Consulting, LLC.</a> with my
          partner <a href="http://jacob-walker.com">Jacob Walker</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I share my life with my wonderful wife Whitney.  We are currently
          expecting our first child, a little girl, this December.  As you can
          imagine, we are both quite excited.
        </p>

        <h2>My Values</h2>
        <p>
          I have always loved learning.  A large portion of my free time is
          spent pursuing a deeper understanding of core design principles,
          application architecture patterns, and researching various
          technologies.  No matter how much I learn, I am never satisfied with
          what I have accomplished.  There is always the desire to push my
          skills one step further.
        </p>

        <p>
          Work ethic is extremely important to me, and something I take immense
          pride in.  In an era where the older values are slipping away, I
          strive at all times to maintain a consistent, unwavering adherence to
          the principles on which I was raised.  My previous employers, as well
          as my clients, have all commented on how well this shines through.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being a part of the developer community is extremely important to me.
          That is why I strive to be involved where I can.  I contribute to <a
          href="http://github.com/keelerm84">open source projects</a> in my
          spare time, contributing in languages like PHP, Ruby, C++ and more.
          I have also attended <a href="http://lonestarphp.com">Lonestar
          PHP</a> the last two years, regulary attend <a
          href="http://nomadphp.com">NomadPHP</a>, and participate in a variety
          of user groups in my area such as <a
          href="http://www.meetup.com/TriDroid/">TriDroid</a>, <a
          href="http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/">The Triangle Ruby
          Brigade</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tripython/">TriPy</a>, <a
          href="http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-JavaScript/">Triangle
          JavaScript</a>, and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recently, a developer community started in the Wichita area (where I
          am originally from), called <a
          href="http://upfrontwichita.com">UpFront Wichita</a>.  Having only
          been a member for one month, I quickly rose to take an active
          leadership role in the group, helping to organize our first
          Hackathon, contributing various features to our RoR site, and
          presenting two talks on git, which can be viewed on my <a
          href="http://www.youtube.com/user/keelerm84ify">YouTube</a> page.
        </p>

        <h2>Desires</h2>
        <p>
          While I do spend as much time as possible refining my skills at home,
          I really want to work with a team of seasoned developers where I can
          continue to grow my knowledge base.  My ideal job would be working at
          a place where testing is a focus, not an afterthought, and continual
          education for the team is a must.  Large scale data and deploying
          code used by thousands of people would be a dream come true.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though I may not currently possess all the experience necessary
          to "run with the big dogs", I am confident my eagerness to learn,
          coupled with my proven ability to quickly pick up new technologies,
          makes me well suited for any position.
