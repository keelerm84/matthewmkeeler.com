> I've had the pleasure of working with Matthew for four years now, Matthew is a well spoken individual, skilled database administrator/programmer, and an excellent web application developer, utilizing PHP5. He is also a good Unix shell programmer, utilizing his skills to automate various tasks that are required when needed. 

> Without a doubt in my mind, Matthew is the fastest learner I've had the pleasure to work with, being able to pick up new languages and technologies is short order. 

> I enjoy all the conversations I had with Matthew when brain storming together. I also enjoy playing ping-pong ("table tennis") with him.

Recommendation from LinkedIn:

> I had the distinct pleasure of working with (and learning from) Mr. Keeler while we were both studying CS and math at Emporia. We've kept in touch since. Of those I've worked with, either in an academic or business setting, Matt is among the very best. When I recently found myself looking for a collaborator on a project, he was the first name that came to mind. He has an exceedingly sharp grasp of concepts, and has both technical skills, as well as being an excellent person to carry a conversation with. He would be a good choice to manage staff, or deal with interpersonal issues. He would be a definite asset to any organization, in a number of key roles.
